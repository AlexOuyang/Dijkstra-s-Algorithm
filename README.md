Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
====================

This is an application of dijkstra's algorithm in processing using java, the numbered dots are nodes, the numbers above the lines that conencted the nodes are the distance between the nodes.

How to use the application:

- press a number to enter a starting node
- press another number to enter an ending node in oder to draw the shortest distane between the nodes
- press 'c' to clear out the map but retains the same map
- press 'a' to generate a new map randomly
